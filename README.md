Elijah Gallery is a modern, production-ready image showcase built with Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Cloudinary. It includes a public gallery and a protected admin upload panel.

## Getting Started

First, create `.env.local` in the project root with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the gallery.

- Public gallery: `/`
- Admin upload: `/admin` (Basic Auth using `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

Uploads are stored in the Cloudinary folder `elijah-gallery`. The gallery lists the latest 100 images.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
